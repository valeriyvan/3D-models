Mount is supposed to be screwd into standard screw wholes of Mark4 frame on fromt top, not rear back. Mount has hatch which holds top mounted battery from sliding toward font.

Reciever doesn't fit its place perfectly. That why I have to redo it later. 

Exported into STL low res but is fully usable.

Later when I purchase lisense for CAD I use I'll update STL file.
