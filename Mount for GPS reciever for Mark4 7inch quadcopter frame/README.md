Mount is supposed to be screwed into standard screw wholes of Mark4 frame on front top (not rear back). Mount has hatch which holds top mounted battery from sliding toward front.

GPS reciever I use doesn't fit its place perfectly. That why I have to fix or redo it later. 

Exported into STL low res but is fully usable. Later when I purchase lisense for CAD I use I'll update STL file.
